project_builder.py

An AI-powered project builder that:
1) Takes a user's project description/requirements
2) Plans and designs the project architecture
3) Creates a project structure with folders and files
4) Implements each file with appropriate code
5) Provides assembly instructions and usage guidance

This system walks an LLM through creating a complete, functional project
from scratch based on the user's requirements.

IMPORTANT: This module is NOT meant to be run directly. It must be run through orchestrator.py
with the --build flag and appropriate arguments. Example:
  python orchestrator.py --build <model> [vision] [--start-step N] [--start-substep ID]

The --start-step and --start-substep arguments can be used to resume from a specific point
if the build process was interrupted.

IMPORTANT: You are implementing a production-ready source file that must be complete,
robust, and maintainable. Minimal or superficial implementations are not acceptable.

CRITICAL: DO NOT WRITE DEMONSTRATION CODE. Write REAL, FUNCTIONAL code that would
actually be used in a production environment. Your code will be saved directly to a file
and is expected to work without modification.

## Project Context
{step_outputs.get(0, '(No vision provided)')}

## Project Structure
The file is part of the following project structure:
```
{structure_content[:2000]}  # Include first 2000 chars of the structure
```

## Relevant Architecture & Design
{step_outputs.get(2, '(No architecture)')[:1000]}  # Only first 1000 chars of architecture
{step_outputs.get(3, '(No structure)')[:1000]}     # Only first 1000 chars of structure

## Implementation Task
Your task is to implement: {file_path}

## Implementation Requirements
1. Code Quality:
   - Production-ready, professional code
   - Comprehensive error handling
   - Complete input validation
   - Proper logging
   - Thorough documentation
   - Clear code organization

2. Technical Requirements:
   - Follow all architectural decisions
   - Implement complete functionality
   - Include ALL necessary imports
   - Handle ALL edge cases
   - Include proper error messages
   - Add debug logging where appropriate

3. Documentation Requirements:
   - File-level documentation
   - Function/class documentation
   - Important code block documentation
   - Usage examples in comments
   - Edge case documentation
   - Error handling documentation

4. Testing Considerations:
   - Make code testable
   - Document test scenarios
   - Handle boundary conditions
   - Consider error scenarios

5. Security & Robustness:
   - Implement security best practices
   - Handle resource cleanup
   - Prevent memory leaks
   - Secure error handling
   - Input sanitization

Remember: This code will be used in production. It must be complete, robust, and maintainable.
Avoid shortcuts or minimal implementations. Write code that you would confidently deploy to production.
